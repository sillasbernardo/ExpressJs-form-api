### ABOUT

  This is a simple API built in ExpressJs to send form values to database. For this project I used google sheets as database.
  
### INSTRUCTIONS

• To run this project you will need Google Sheets API enabled so you have the key from Google Console Platform. And you will need the spreadsheet's id to save data.
• In case you should access this over web, you'll need a Trusted CA Certificate.
